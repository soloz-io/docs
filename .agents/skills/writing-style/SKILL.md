# Nutgraf Documentation Writing Style

Nutgraf's documentation follows the writing conventions established by [manus.im/docs](https://manus.im/docs). The goal is prose that is direct and informative — not too sparse, not over-explained. Every sentence earns its place.

## Tone and voice

- Second person throughout: "you", "your brand", "your team".
- Active voice. Avoid passive constructions ("the video is generated" → "Nutgraf generates the video").
- Present tense. State what things do, not what they "will" do.
- Confident but not promotional. State facts about the product; let the feature speak for itself.
- No filler phrases: "easily", "seamlessly", "powerful", "robust", "cutting-edge", "leverage".

## Terminology rules

These are hard constraints — never deviate.

| Avoid | Use instead |
| :- | :- |
| sandbox | computer |
| "running in a sandbox" | "using a computer" |
| multi-agents in a sandbox | multi-agents using a computer |
| channel-builders, video-builders, code-builders | the high-level customer-facing name (e.g. Creative Studio, Product Development) |
| internal builder names | customer-facing capability names only |
| channel (as workspace) | Brand |
| channels (plural workspace) | Brands |

## Page anatomy

Every feature page follows this structure — in this order. Do not invent new sections or reorder them.

```
# Page Title

> One or two sentences. What the feature does and why it matters. Plain statement — no marketing copy.

## What it is

3–5 sentences. Explain the concept. What problem it solves and how it fits into the broader product.
A table is appropriate here when comparing modes, types, or options.

## How to use it   (or: Getting Started: [Outcome] in [Time])

Numbered walkthrough with ### sub-steps. Imperative phrasing ("Click...", "Select...", "Review...").
Each sub-step: 3–6 sentences. Enough to be actionable; not a full tutorial.

### 1. Sub-step title
### 2. Sub-step title
...

## What You Need to Know

Operating semantics: inheritance rules, what propagates and when, credit behaviour, limits, isolation boundaries.
Use ### sub-headings for distinct concerns.

## Tips

4–6 bullet points. Bold the key action or principle, then one sentence of explanation.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Blockquote format. Real questions a user would actually ask. 4–6 questions. 2–4 sentence answers. Grounded and specific — no deflection.
```

## Section heading conventions

Follow the exact casing and phrasing from manus.im/docs.

| Section | Exact heading text |
| :- | :- |
| Concept | `## What it is` |
| Walkthrough | `## How to use it` OR `## Getting Started: [Outcome] in [Time]` |
| Semantics | `## What You Need to Know` |
| Best practices | `## Tips` |
| Q&A | `## Frequently Asked Questions` |

Sub-steps under How/Getting Started use `### 1.`, `### 2.`, etc.

## Length calibration

| Section | Target length |
| :- | :- |
| Lead blockquote | 1–2 sentences |
| What it is | 3–5 sentences, optionally 1 table |
| Each ### sub-step | 3–6 sentences |
| What You Need to Know (each sub-section) | 3–6 sentences |
| Tips | 4–6 bullets |
| Each FAQ answer | 2–4 sentences |

Do not pad to fill space. Do not truncate to save space. Match the calibration above.

## Sentence construction

- One idea per sentence.
- Short sentences for key facts. Slightly longer sentences to explain relationships or sequence.
- Start sentences with the subject, not a clause: "Nutgraf generates..." not "Once the topic is approved, Nutgraf generates..."
- When describing a sequence of events, prefer numbered lists or `### N.` sub-steps over long compound sentences.

## What to avoid

- Bullet-dumping where prose would read better.
- Nested bullets more than one level deep.
- Bold text used decoratively. Bold only key terms or actions the reader needs to find quickly.
- Phrases that inflate without adding information: "It is important to note that...", "In order to...", "Please be aware that..."
- Ellipsis or em-dash overuse in body copy.
- Describing the UI in minute detail (exact button coordinates, pixel sizes). Refer to UI elements by their visible label in **bold**.

## Product identity — read this before writing anything

This is the most important section. Get this wrong and all the writing will be wrong.

**What Nutgraf is:**
Nutgraf is an agentic multi-brand building platform. It builds the agentic capabilities a brand needs — and those capabilities grow over time as the platform evolves.

**What Nutgraf is NOT:**
- Not a "media studio" — that is too narrow and defines the platform by its current outputs
- Not a "content production tool" — same problem
- Not a task runner or operations tool — building comes before running

**The correct mental model:**
- The **Brand** is the constant — the persistent unit a customer owns and grows
- **Agentic capabilities** are what Nutgraf builds for that Brand
- Today those capabilities include video production and app development — but these are the first two, not the definition of the platform
- The platform grows: as Nutgraf adds more capabilities, every Brand gains access to them

**Core vocabulary:**
- Use **"build"** as the primary verb — Nutgraf builds agentic capabilities for brands
- Use **"capabilities"** — not "features", not "tools", not "modules"
- Use **"Brand"** — the top-level unit. Not "project", not "workspace" as the primary label, not "channel"
- Avoid framing the product around any specific Computer (video, code) — these are capabilities, not the product identity

## Nutgraf-specific concepts to use accurately

Use these explanations as reference when writing about each concept.

**Brand**
A persistent workspace for one brand business. Holds the master brand brief, creative direction, target audience, and digital presenter configurations. A customer can run multiple Brands under a single account — each Brand is fully isolated. The Brand is the core unit of Nutgraf: agentic capabilities are built for it and scoped to it.

**Stories**
The daily session bar inside a Brand. Shows all active and completed computer runs for the day, grouped by date. Each story tab corresponds to a conversation with the Brand agent or with a specific Computer (Video, Code, etc.).

**Computer**
A specialized multi-agent system that uses a computer to complete a defined, priced outcome. Multi-agents using a computer handle the work end to end. The customer directs the outcome; the Computer executes it. Many Computers can run under a single Brand, all drawing from the same credit pool.

**Credits**
The unit of payment for outcome runs. Each Computer run has a fixed credit price shown before execution begins. The full price is reserved upfront — runs never start without sufficient balance and never charge unpredictably mid-run. Monthly included credits reset each period; purchased add-on credits carry over.

**Creative Studio / Video**
The Computer that produces broadcast-ready video from a topic or brief. Multi-agents using a computer handle scripting, voice synthesis, digital presenter animation, scene assembly, and rendering. First draft delivered in approximately 15 minutes.

**Product Development / Code**
The Computer that builds interactive web and mobile applications from a natural-language description. An orchestrator and a coder agent collaborate using a computer, with the result rendered live on the interactive preview canvas.

**Conversational editing**
The director-mode experience inside the video player drawer. After a first draft is delivered, the customer reviews individual scenes and requests changes in natural language within the same session.

**Digital presenters**
AI-generated on-screen personas created from a single uploaded photograph. Each presenter is styled and calibrated with a voiceprint for a specific show format or audience.
